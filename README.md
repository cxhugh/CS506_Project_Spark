##Abstract:
BUâ€™s Institute for Sustainable Energy (ISE) is a University-wide institute that promotes faculty research. We have partnered with Michael Walsh and Adam Pollack to design and analyze a database of tax parcels and building permits for populating a building energy systems inventory and investigating the trends and distribution of heating and energy efficient systems. The goals of the project are: 1) determine which communities are more likely to have heat pumps, based on various demographics, 2) determine which communities are benefitting from energy efficient systems or not, and 3) implement a predictive model which determines which parcel building has a particular type of heating system. 4) Visualize the distribution of heating systems in Boston. We incorporate the permit and parcel database, and the parcel data key dataset to help BU ISE determine which buildings are most likely to have heat pumps.
