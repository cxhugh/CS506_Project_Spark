## Abstract:
BUâ€™s Institute for Sustainable Energy (ISE) is a University-wide institute that promotes faculty research. We have partnered with Michael Walsh and Adam Pollack to design and analyze a database of tax parcels and building permits for populating a building energy systems inventory and investigating the trends and distribution of heating and energy efficient systems. The goals of the project are: 1) determine which communities are more likely to have heat pumps, based on various demographics, 2) determine which communities are benefitting from energy efficient systems or not, and 3) implement a predictive model which determines which parcel building has a particular type of heating system. 4) Visualize the distribution of heating systems in Boston. We incorporate the permit and parcel database, and the parcel data key dataset to help BU ISE determine which buildings are most likely to have heat pumps.

## (Cleaning_Parcel_Data)_Zixin_Ding
This is how we cleaned up the parcel data(Boston Property Assessment Data), and the process is described in 3.1 of our final report. We used the cleaned-up version for most of data analysis and classification model.

## Permit_Solar.csv and Permit_Solar_Stack_Bar_Chart(Fig5.14) (Zixin Ding)
See Section 5.3 and Fig 5.14. Permit_Solar.csv is produced by filtering in the numbers before kilowatts in comments column of Boston Permits Dataset.

## Map_Visualization.R
See Section 5.1.3 for the maps for heat types distribution in Boston.
